# BAG3 Co-IP MS Analysis
#### *This analysis is considered complete and should not see major updates*

Analysis of BAG3 Co-IP MS data

In order to run and view the results of this analysis, the prerequisite data is required.
Please contact me at emir.turkes@eturkes.com if you are interested.
After obtaining the data, it should be unzipped and its directory moved to the project root and renamed as `gdrive`.

A Docker image for this project is available from [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/eturkes/bag3-co-ip).
This is the recommended way to reproduce and explore the project.

To run all scripts and generate an HTML report in the `results` directory, just run:
```
docker-compose run all
```

To open RStudio, run:
```
docker-compose up rstudio
```
It will be available in your web browser at the address [localhost:8789](http://localhost:8789).
