	abstract = {The quantification of differences between two or more physiological states of a biological system is among the most important but also most challenging technical tasks in proteomics. In addition to the classical methods of differential protein gel or blot staining by dyes and fluorophores, mass-spectrometry-based quantification methods have gained increasing popularity over the past five years. Most of these methods employ differential stable isotope labeling to create a specific mass tag that can be recognized by a mass spectrometer and at the same time provide the basis for quantification. These mass tags can be introduced into proteins or peptides (i) metabolically, (ii) by chemical means, (iii) enzymatically, or (iv) provided by spiked synthetic peptide standards. In contrast, label-free quantification approaches aim to correlate the mass spectrometric signal of intact proteolytic peptides or the number of peptide sequencing events with the relative or absolute protein quantity directly. In this review, we critically examine the more commonly used quantitative mass spectrometry methods for their individual merits and discuss challenges in arriving at meaningful interpretations of quantitative proteomic data.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Spectral count data generated from label-free tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomic experiments can be used to quantify protein’s abundances reliably. Comparing spectral count data from different sample groups such as control and disease is an essential step in statistical analysis for the determination of altered protein level and biomarker discovery. The Fisher’s exact test, the G-test, the t-test and the local-pooled-error technique (LPE) are commonly used for differential analysis of spectral count data. However, our initial experiments in two cancer studies show that the current methods are unable to declare at 95\% conﬁdence level a number of protein markers that have been judged to be differential on the basis of the biology of the disease and the spectral count numbers. A shortcoming of these tests is that they do not take into account within- and between-sample variations together. Hence, our aim is to improve upon existing techniques by incorporating both the within- and between-sample variations.},

	abstract = {The vocabulary of theoretical statistics can be diﬃcult to embrace from the viewpoint of computational proteomics research, even though the notions it conveys are essential to publication guidelines. For example, “adjusted p-values”, “qvalues”, and “false discovery rates” are essentially similar concepts, whereas “false discovery rate” and “false discovery proportion” must not be confused, even though “rate” and “proportion” are related in everyday language. In the interdisciplinary context of proteomics, such subtleties may cause misunderstandings. This article aims to provide an easy-to-understand explanation of these four notions (and a few other related ones). Their statistical foundations are dealt with from a perspective that largely relies on intuition, addressing mainly protein quantiﬁcation but also, to some extent, peptide identiﬁcation. In addition, a clear distinction is made between concepts that deﬁne an individual property (i.e., related to a peptide or a protein) and those that deﬁne a set property (i.e., related to a list of peptides or proteins).},
